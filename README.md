# Token Economy Agent Based Model
A model of an economy where behavior is modeled at the agent (individual actor) level. These agents are part of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Suitable incentive mechanisms are desired such that will motivate these agents to act in line with the objectives of the Enterprise.

The analysis herein is on the effect of different incentive mechanisms and what volumes of incentives to give that will contribute best to the realization of the goals of the Enterprise.

An agent-based model is prefered since we want to establish the effect of random incentivization in the network on individual agents and the effect of certain behaviors by majority/ sections of the network on individual agents.

Behavior in the economy is restricted to
* registering electronic assets on the blockchain (tokenization)
* demonstrating that the electronic asset is still functional and therefore valueable. This is done by sending a request to the organization's server at least once a month
* providing 
based  (ABM) where analysis is on the effect of incentivization on individual agents when incentives are randomly issued to a fraction of the collective.

The entities in the economy include:
* the blockchain on which the (decentralized application) dApp is developed
* the Enterprise developing and managing the dApp
* agents who put electronic assets on the blockchain
* liquidity providers who offer 

Objects in the economy include:
* the dApp created by the Enterprise, used to register electonic assets on the blockchain
* the native token of the blockchain on which the dApp in developed. To avoid being too abstract, we will assume that this is the Algorand blockchain, whose token is the ALGO.
* the token given in exchange for registering an electronic asset on the blockchain (through this dApp)

The goals of the Enterprise are to maximise its profits and the utility of its token. It makes profits by taking a certain percentage of the value of assets put on the blockchain.
The token provides utility (for out intents and purposes) as long as it is easily exchangeable and has a stable exchange rate.
